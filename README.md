Hi! I’m Benjamin 👋

I'm a Junior Developer, working with front-end software. I have a BSc in Criminology, and I love making things.

I completed TechNative Academy's 8 week boot camp, and have ben using HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, and React.
We also worked on Agile Methodology and AI Governance, as well as GitHub and Git Bash

My current projects are Studio Celest: a modern clothing webpage, and my flag finder tool, that uses an API to fetch data based on your chosen flag request.

My current interest is fully understanding React, and applying it to my projects. 
I am also working with a team of developers to create a full stackapplicaiton called 'Gig Buddy', which compiles gig and concert data in one palce to make finding events easier!
